  description: Krobi screech at your passing, as you ford the Crimson River. The refuse
    of the ones who came before litters the shallows. A metal box inlaid with black
    glass. A scrap of that thing PLA-STICK, which never rots. A length of the singing
    wire, broken from its mouthpiece. The Dit and the Dah stir as you pass, but they
    have no loyalty to such things, not anymore.

    inactiveExplanation: You must scale the mountains of garbage to proceed further
      north, and that would take more time than you have. There must be an easier
