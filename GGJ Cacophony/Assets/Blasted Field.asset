  description: 'The earth has been baked harder than steel in the Blasted Field. It
    is sore going for your bare feet, which are soon studded with chips of hard stone
    and the thorns of the stunted shrubs, but you carry on without pause. If you fall
    in the Field, you shall not be the first. There are worse places to die, than
    amid the warriors now dust. '
