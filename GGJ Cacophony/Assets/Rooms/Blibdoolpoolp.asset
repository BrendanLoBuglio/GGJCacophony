  description: "Ah, Blibdoolpoolp. What more can be said about this stretch of steaming
    trash? The garbage is bountiful and rich and always at least partially edible,
    and the burrows of the clever Rakki border this corner of the Labyrinth. They
    dry-wring their hands, black masks wrinkled as they squint at your passing. \u201CMarsu!
    Cousin Marsu! What scavenge do you seek?\u201D You tell them, and they laugh,
    for only the dead could be bolder."
