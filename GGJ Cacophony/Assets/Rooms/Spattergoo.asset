  description: You wade through the mires of the Spattergoo, where now even Vermi
    dare not go. The sludge pulses, green as paradise, and incontinent bubbles follow
    in your wake like lost children. Around you, the walls of the Labyrinth of Trash
    lean inward, their shadows lengthening as the plague sun limps across the bruised
    sky.
