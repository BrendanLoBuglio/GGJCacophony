  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: The Weeping Plague has ravaged these lands, and the graves have swollen
    on its victims. You enter the catacombs beyond Meol Mial, your snout turned high
    as the damp and the dead invade your nostrils. Long rows of tombstones identify
    the fallen Felurri, who rot like napping dams in their marble caskets.
  objects:
  - name: grave
    inspectionDescription: Graves litter the catacombs.
    validActions:
    - actionName: dig
      events:
      - actionDescription: "You find the grave of Ay L\u2019mayo, buried under the
          sign of SeeLing, They That Watch. \u201CShe is fresh interned to the embrace
          of stone, Marsu pouch-bearer,\u201D says the sorrowful gravekeeper, as he
          prowls his dingy crypt. \u201CFind ye solace, for no tears cross the veil
          of death, nay, not even those of the sickened weepers.\u201D He stalks back
          into the shadows, lantern clamped between his teeth."

          it being set only a fortnight ago. The limp corpse of Ay is more fractious,
          and takes three tries to pull free from her sepulchral bed. The lesser Vermi,
          those maggots and worms without name, flee from their feast as you begin
          the work of cutting the Felurri\u2019s skin free. Your teeth and claws make
          quick work of the tissue between muscle and skin, and soon enough the hide
          has been extricated from the flesh it so long covered."
