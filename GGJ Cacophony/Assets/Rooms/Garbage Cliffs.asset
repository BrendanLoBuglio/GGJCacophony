  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: "The Garbage Cliffs loom over you, ripening in the midday sun. A one-eyed
    Krobi lands before you, its beak held at an imperious angle. \u201CHave your pickings
    from the foot of our lands,\u201D he declares, \u201Cbut seek you not the territories
    beyond. Such is the will of Moar Chezbur al-Pusai, him of golden fur and ebon
    claw! Such is the will of the Felurri King!\u201D Your scar throbs at the name.
    This is the one you must seek.\r\n\r\nAround you there are stinking heaps of midden,
    infested with infant Dromii. Clear spheres of light unwavering, although the everlasting
    fires were long ago extinguished. Here, the ancient tools of the kitchens that
    overflowed: knives of rusted steel, a batter for flour and sweets, the shakers
    of the salts. There, soft thrones, musty with the ages: long, short, wood and
    fabric all. Krobi have nests in every nook. Their beady eyes glint as you examine
    their hoard."
  objects:
  - name: batter
    inspectionDescription: The tool of the ones who came before is rusted, but still
      whole. The beaters glint as you drag the mixer out of the shadows.

    - actionName: eat;chew;bite;swallow;ingest
      events:
      - actionDescription: You swallow the batter. It scratches your throat going
          down.

  - name: crows
    inspectionDescription: Krobi are the most intelligent of the Vermi, or so, at
      least, they like to say. Those nesting among the Cliffs are fiendishly loyal,
      to each other and their masters.
    validActions:
    - actionName: tell
      events:
      - actionDescription: Once you notify the other Krobi, they are swift in the
          burial. You cannot fault them for disloyalty, at least. They overturn the
          sewage-steeped earth with beak and talon, and bury Caw-Cawraw-CAW with much
          respect if little ceremony. The iron tankard they unearthed in making the
          grave they leave at the foot of the cliffs, uninspected and unremarked upon.

  - name: helium tank;helium
    inspectionDescription: The tank is too thick to gnaw through, but there is a nozzle
      and spot. The weight does not shift when you drag it into the open. Nothing
      rattles or moves.

      - actionDescription: "With nimble paws, you turn the valve of the once-buried
          tank and clamp your teeth around the spout. As your stomach swells with
          the ethereal gas, you are imbued with such airiness that you begin to ascend,
          buoyed by a fortunate wind. You hold your breath as you float past the Cliffs,
          bloated on that curious substance \u201Chelium,\u201D and even the Krobi
          cannot keep pace with you. When at last you are forced to exhale, you have
          already flown past Sneekachik, capital of the Roden, and that hive of villainy
          Xor\u2019xr\u2019xak. You land at the village of Meol Mial, emboldened.\r\n"
