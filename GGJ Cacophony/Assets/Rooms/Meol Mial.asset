  description: 'Never was there a place more wretched than Meol Mial, village at the
    foot of the Felurri Palace. You pad through the streets, and attract the green
    eyes of the Felurri wherever you go, for no longer are there towering mounds of
    garbage to obfuscate your passage. The whole forsaken place has been licked clean,
    and to pass unnoticed here you must find costume rather than camouflage. '
  objects:
  - name: cat
    inspectionDescription: These Felurri are cleaner, more dignified then the ones
      you saw in the trash mounds.
