  description: "You are Vermi, Vermi\u2019s daughter, and you are burdened with the
    gift of the Dit and the Dah. For many moons you have wandered the tunnels of the
    Ceuler, clad in garb of grey and silver, and now you stand before the doors to
    the overworld. An iron padlock, heavy with rust, seals the way; its weathered
    dials have not turned in many a year, but they must turn again ere you may leave.
    Only the Dit and the Dah know the number."
