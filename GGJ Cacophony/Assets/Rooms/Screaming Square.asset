  description: "You are Vermi, Vermi\u2019s daughter, and you are burdened with the
    gift of the Dit and the Dah. For many moons you have wandered the tunnels of the
    Ceuler, clad in garb of grey and silver, and when you emerge once more amid the
    cracked black stones of the Screaming Square, the sunlight greets you like an
    old friend. The scar along the nape of your neck twinges, both mark of your exile
    and festering executioner, and weakness buckles your knees. Soon the poison shall
    claim you. The key to your survival lies beyond, in the kingdom of the Felurri."

    inactiveExplanation: To go further south is to enter the hunting grounds of the
      sleek Canim. You should not wander that way, not even if you were at full strength.
