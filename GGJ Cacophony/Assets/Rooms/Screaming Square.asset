  description: The lock falls away, and you emerge amid the cracked black stones of
    the Screaming Square, where the sunlight greets you like an old friend. The scar
    along the nape of your neck twinges, both mark of your exile and festering executioner,
    and weakness buckles your knees. Soon the poison shall claim you. The key to your
    survival lies beyond, in the kingdom of the Felurri.
