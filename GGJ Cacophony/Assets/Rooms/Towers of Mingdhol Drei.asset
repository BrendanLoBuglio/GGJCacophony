  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: "The trash piles high amid the Towers of Mingdhol Drei, whose glass
    faces stare in every direction except that from which the doom came. Dromii buzz
    around you, and fling their questions like flecks of spray. \u201CWhence came
    you, Marsu, silver-clad? Where shall you go?\u201D You give no answer. You are
    the last of your kind, and you will remember the fallen."
  objects:
  - name: glass
    inspectionDescription: The mirror sheen of the broken glass reflects your snout,
      your whiskers, your eyes black as coal. They shall not see your like again when
      you go, not for a long time.
    validActions:
    - actionName: eat
      events:
      - actionDescription: You swallow the glass. It is not the sharpest thing you've
          ever eaten, nor is it the hardest.

    inspectionDescription: The Dromii are small, but abundant. Nowhere in the Labyrinth
      can you escape them, but they mean no harm.
    validActions:
    - actionName: eat
      events:
      - actionDescription: You consume a handful of flittering Dromii. They scream
          for their families.
