  description: Krobi screech at your passing, as you ford the Crimson River. The refuse
    of the ones who came before litters the shallows. A metal box inlaid with black
    glass. A scrap of that thing PLA-STICK, which never rots. A length of the singing
    wire, broken from its mouthpiece. The Dit and the Dah stir as you pass, but they
    have no loyalty to such things, not anymore.

  - name: antenna
    inspectionDescription: The wire that once sang lies limp in the currents of the
      river. The Dit and the Dah recoil as you inspect it.

      way past.
