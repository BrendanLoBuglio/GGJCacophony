  description: The only Felurri in the Labyrinth of Trash gather beneath the glow
    of the Dribbling Lights. Here are the mangy, the balding, the three-legged and
    the bent-whiskered. Even at this pitiful juncture, among the most pitiable of
    people, they hold themselves with the arrogance of their kind. They whisper as
    you pass, and though you do not listen, you cannot help but hear.
